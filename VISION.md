# GnuTheme IRC Services - VISION

GnuTheme was inspired by the Atheme Development Group deciding to end 
future development on Atheme IRC Services.  

Our vision is to be a suitable successor to Atheme for IRC networks 
that ran Atheme.  We've added new features, fixed bugs and have more 
planned for the future.  Be sure to read NEWS.md for more specifics.  

GnuTheme desires to maintain compatibility with networks that ran 
Atheme, however in some cases this may change if it would actually 
benefit GnuTheme development and networks running GnuTheme.

If you have an idea for GnuTheme, please feel free to open an issue 
on GitHub.  We're generally open to (good) ideas.  Bugs should also 
be reported as an issue on GitHub or seek support on IRC.
