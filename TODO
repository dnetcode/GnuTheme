Some ideas concerning things that we may eventually work on.

* cidr limits in /os clones
* think about additional timestamps for recognized vs identified
* account merging?
* /cs rename?
* more fault codes
* /ns ghost does not allow disconnecting a user that does not use a registered
nick but is logged in to an account with a known password (it is possible to
disconnect any user logged in to the same account as you); however, it would be
bad to check the same password against two accounts (nick/login). new syntax?
* make sendpass/setpass codes expire after some time
